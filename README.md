The project is an ancient project based on RPG Maker VX Ace.

There was no actual coding anywhere when the project was being done.

Just as a placeholder.

## How to play

### Requirements

You may need to install RPG Maker VX Ace RTP (runtime package) before playing the game. It can be downloaded [here](https://dl.degica.com/rpgmakerweb/run-time-packages/RPGVXAce_RTP.zip). In case the link becomes invalid, just [Google "RPG Maker VX Ace RTP"](https://www.google.com/search?q=RPG+Maker+VX+Ace+RTP), and you can easily find the RTP to download.

### Beat the Game!

Something important that's not said throughout the game (It is our fault) is that we need to fulfill the following conditions to make us able to defeat the final BOSS:

- Possession of item "物理导学".
- Character "大王八" is in the troop.

There was a sheep at a hospital sitting on a chair. It has the item "物理导学". You can talk with that sheep and feed it "乌鸦简笔画" to acquire the item "物理导学".

## How to edit

### Requirements

You need RPG Maker VX Ace to modify this project. [Buy the software on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/220700/RPG_Maker_VX_Ace/) and everything is ok. However, what if your **budget** is **NOT** ok? Try [find a cracked one from Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=RPG+Maker+VX+Ace+Cracked)! Plenty of cracked RPG Maker VX Ace resources are available on the Internet, particularly if you are good at distinguishing malware from the real ones.

### Project File

The project file is game.rvproj2, located in the root directory. You can open that with your RPG Maker VX Ace.

## FAQ: Have an interest in such a time-wasting game?

Instead of some game, it is better called just an archive. It is just a personal archive of history.

I honestly had not started coding then, but a considerable effort was made on this game. It was when "having made something by yourself" seemed so wonderful, even if it was just a level editor that generates binary files unreadable to any other programs or some jumpy interactive pop-up windows ridiculous enough to be called a "game".
